## Description

- This repository contains a range of personal projects that I have undertaken in my spare time. These projects include a variety of different tools and applications, designed to help automate tasks or to help me learn new skills. 

- `csv_to_ffmpeg_cmd.py`: Split video files into smaller individual video files using ffmpeg.  
- `generate_ffmpeg_bash_script_on_provided_path.py`: Crop video files into a smaller size to eliminate unnecessary parts using ffmpeg.
